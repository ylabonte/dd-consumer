# Simple Download Delegation Consumer

See: https://github.com/ylabonte/chrome-simple-download-delegator

## Requirements
* Java 8
* Gradle 5

## Run
```bash
$ gradle bootRun
```
This will build, test and run the project for you.

## Build
This will (re)build the project (`bootRun` also does). Useful if you
only want the JAR file for execution.
```bash
$ gradle build
```

## Test
Only run tests. Useful during development.
```bash
$ gradle test
```
